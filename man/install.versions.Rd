\usage{
install.versions(pkgs, versions, lib, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkgs}{character vector of the names of packages that should be
downloaded and installed}

\item{versions}{character vector of the versions of packages to be
downloaded and installed. If this has the same length as \code{pkgs}
versions will correspond to those packages. If this has length one
the same version will be used for all packages. If it has any other
length an error will be thrown.}

\item{lib}{character vector giving the library directories where to
install the packages. Recycled as needed. If missing, defaults to the
first element of \code{\link{.libPaths}()}.}

\item{\dots}{other arguments to be passed to \code{\link{install.packages}}.
The arguments \code{repos} and \code{contriburl} (at least) will
be ignored as the function uses the MRAN server to retrieve package versions.}
}
