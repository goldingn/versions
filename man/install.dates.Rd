\usage{
install.dates(pkgs, dates, lib, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkgs}{character vector of the names of packages that should be
downloaded and installed}

\item{dates}{character or Date vector of the dates for which to install the
latest versions of \code{pkgs}. If a character vector, it must be in the format
'yyyy-mm-dd', e.g. '2014-09-17'. If this has the same length as \code{pkgs}
 versions will correspond to those packages. If this has length one
 the same version will be used for all packages. If it has any other
 length an error will be thrown. Dates before 2014-09-17 will cause an error
 as MRAN does not archive before that date.}

\item{lib}{character vector giving the library directories where to
install the packages. Recycled as needed. If missing, defaults to the
first element of \code{\link{.libPaths}()}.}

\item{\dots}{other arguments to be passed to \code{\link{install.packages}}.
The arguments \code{repos} and \code{contriburl} (at least) will
be ignored as the function uses the MRAN server to retrieve package versions.}
}
\description{

 CRAN as of a specific date from the MRAN server.
